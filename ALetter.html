                <p>I've been holding onto these feelings for a while now, unsure of the right words to say, but today, I've found the courage to speak my heart.<br></p>
        
                <p>From the moment I met you, something inside me changed. Your presence brings light into my days, your laughter is a melody I never get tired of hearing, and every little thing you do makes my world feel a little warmer. I never thought I'd feel this way, but here I am, unable to ignore what my heart has been telling me all alongâ€”I have feelings for you. <br></p>
        
                <p>I don't expect anything in return, and I don't want to make things complicated. I just wanted to be honest with you because you deserve to know how truly special you are to me. No matter what, I cherish our connection and will always be grateful for you. <br></p>
